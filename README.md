# aibot

This is yet another handy GPT bot for Linux terminal. It helps you figure out commands in your command line so that you can do what you need to do. :)

## Use:
Make sure to use "chmod +x ai" to make the script executable, move the script to PATH, and then use with:

ai "string to send AI" *example:*

**ai "find all folders in / named bin"**


### Tested and working great on Termux.
