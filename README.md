# aibot

This is yet another handy GPT bot for Linux terminal. It helps you figure out commands in your command line so that you can do what you need to do. :)

## Use:
Make sure to use "chmod +x ai" to make the script executable, move the script to PATH, and then use with:

ai "string to send AI" *example:*

**ai "find all folders in / named bin"**

## Installer:
Not sure what $PATH is? clone my repo, enter into it, and run the following:
```
chmod +x install
sh install
```
This will find PATH and move my script there for you. 


### Tested and working great on Termux.
